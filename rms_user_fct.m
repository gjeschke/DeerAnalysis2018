function rms = rms_user_fct(v,x,y,userfunction)
%RMS2D	Root mean square error of user background function fct(k,t)
%	rms = rms_user_fct(v,x,y,fct).
%	
%  Parameters: v(2) Amplitude, v(1) decay constant k
%  fct is a Matlab expression that must contain variable k and t and must
%  not contain any other variables, amplitude scaling is external to this
%  function
