function [tdipn,trace0,trace1,stddev]=compare_modnorm_linear(tdip0,deer0,tdip1,deer1,depth0,depth1)
%
% Accepts two DEER time-domain traces deer1 and deer0 that are normalized at t=0 (to V0)
% Scales the modulated part of deer1 so that it has minimum r.m.s.
% deviation from the modulated part of deer0
% traces must be one-dimensional
%
% the time axis for computation of the scaling factor is the overlapping 
% range of both time axes, the time increment the larger of the two time
% increments
%
% Output: unchanged trace0 (for backward compatibility), scaled trace1 and
% time axis tdipn for which comparison was performed
% and standard deviation of points between traces (stddev)
%
% Used for comparison of form factors
