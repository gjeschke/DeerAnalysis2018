function [tdipn,trace0,trace1,stddev]=compare_modnorm(tdip0,deer0,tdip1,deer1)
%
% Accepts two DEER time-domain traces deer1 and deer0 that are normalized at t=0 (to V0)
% Scales the modulated part of deer1 so that it has minimum r.m.s.
% deviation from the modulated part of deer0
%
% the time axes of both decays must have the same spacing
% the shorter trace determines the number of points used in r.m.s. error
% computation
%
% Output: unchanged or truncated trace0, scaled and possibly truncated trace1
% and standard deviation of points between traces (stddev)
%
% Used for comparison of DEER decays
